"""
This file contains the X and Y coordinates for all the different tabs that need to be pressed with the mouse.
Using findCoordinates.py you can quickly change these: just run findCoordinates then hover your mouse over the tab you want for a couple seconds.
    The last set of printed coordinates should be correct.
WARNING: you only get 10 seconds, you can change that as well.
